# BEGAN WIRING

I laid out all of the parts I had, and spent today wiring the components together, 
with the relevant image given:

So far, I've wired the breadboard and the Arduino board together. As I'm assembling the LCD to wire it,
I've come across a problem with my breadboard. It is my first time working with an LCD and header pins,
so I've learned that I needed to attach them both. For this project, unless it's later required for
funcitonality, I've opted to not solder the header pins to the LCD, only because I currently don't have
the tools to do so.

When trying to attach the header pins to the breadboard, I've encountered an issue where the pins would
not properly insert even with heavy force. It could be a problem with either the size of the pins or the 
design of the breadboard. Either way, I'm not too surprised that I've come across issues, since I got this
kit for cheap (Items in said kit that I'm using in this project include the breadboard, header pins, 
and most M-M wires). To mitigate this issue, I've split the sixteen header pin row that is required for the 
LCD into four smaller sections (each with four pins). This has made insertion into the breadboard significantly
easier.

I ended up having to split the third section of header pins (pins E42-E45) into two smaller sections (two
header pin groupings, one between E42-E43 and the other between E44-E45) because one of the holes in that
area was being particularly difficult. I eventually managed to get all pins in and the LCD fixed onto it.

I've finished initial wiring of the project, and the paths to reference images are given:

# CONTINUED WIRING

I continued wiring the LCD and chip as according to the guide, with a few minor tweaks.

I've encountered a potential setback where I realized I don't have the proper 160 ohm resistor that the guide
suggested. In light of this, I opted to use the next closest resister I had without going below 160, which 
was a 220 ohm resistor. I'm hoping it won't reduce the current too much to the point of the system not working
as intended. I plan on replacing the part later anyways.

I also wanted to mention that I've noticed the cluttering of the wires become a bit overwhelming. My goal at
this moment is to finish the project and ensure it's operating as intended, and afterwards strip and trim
the wires to appropriate lengths.

# I also need to take a note of supplies I'm currently missing: Power cable, piezo speaker, wire cutters, 
and potential soldering equipment for the LCD. I will continue to update on new equipment and implementations
as the project goes on.

I continued to add the two pushbuttons and the photoresistors to the board, with supporting images attached:
