# BEGAN WIRING

I laid out all of the parts I had, and spent today wiring the components together, 
with the relevant image given:

So far, I've wired the breadboard and the Arduino board together. As I'm assembling the LCD to wire it,
I've come across a problem with my breadboard. It is my first time working with an LCD and header pins,
so I've learned that I needed to attach them both. For this project, unless it's later required for
funcitonality, I've opted to not solder the header pins to the LCD, only because I currently don't have
the tools to do so.

When trying to attach the header pins to the breadboard, I've encountered an issue where the pins would
not properly insert even with heavy force. It could be a problem with either the size of the pins or the 
design of the breadboard. Either way, I'm not too surprised that I've come across issues, since I got this
kit for cheap (Items in said kit that I'm using in this project include the breadboard, header pins, 
and most M-M wires). To mitigate this issue, I've split the sixteen header pin row that is required for the 
LCD into four smaller sections (each with four pins). This has made insertion into the breadboard significantly
easier.

I ended up having to split the third section of header pins (pins E42-E45) into two smaller sections (two
header pin groupings, one between E42-E43 and the other between E44-E45) because one of the holes in that
area was being particularly difficult. I eventually managed to get all pins in and the LCD fixed onto it.

I've finished initial wiring of the project, and the paths to reference images are given:
